Combined with passion, creativity, and intention, Vicky guides her students toward an inviting yoga experience that is both invigorating and enjoyable. Her teaching style is Vinyasa Flow and she isn’t afraid to challenge her students to the next level, always being mindful of where her students are at in their practice. Working in a corporate environment, running a small business, and teaching yoga, she understands the definition of a busy and fast pace lifestyle. She is an advocate for sharing the importance of practicing yoga, healthy living, and giving back to oneself. Her two biggest passions are serving others and traveling, which she is able to do with yoga retreats. She lives by the mantra: “Creating a world where all beings are loved, honored, appreciated, and fully expressed.”
