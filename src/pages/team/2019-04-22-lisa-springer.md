Hi, my name is Lisa, I am a 200 hour certified yoga instructor. I am a registered nurse who specializes in mental health, pain, and women and infants. I love to help ease pain, anxiety and depression though reiki, gentle yoga and breathwork.

Each and every person is worthy and can reach their full potential through yoga. Yoga changed my life and I am so excited to guide you in your transformation to peace, joy health!
