Asha was a competitive athlete for most of her life and found yoga during a very transitional period. Her enthusiasm for life, active spirit, and passion for being able to connect with those around her by staying grounded and humble is what continuously drives her back to her mat. Asha's goal is to pass along her love for yoga and provide mindfulness resources to help foster children and anyone she meets along the way.
