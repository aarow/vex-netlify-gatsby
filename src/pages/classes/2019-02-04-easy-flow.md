  Here at Vex we believe life is all about balance. Having a healthy
  relationship between taking care of yourself, your family, and work. We also
  believe in being true to yourself, and that includes being true to your
  emotions. So often in life we get caught up in social expectations, or dwell
  on our inner feelings. Instead of expressing ourselves, we hide and harbor in
  the stress of our emotions. This class is about letting those social
  expectations go, and embracing exactly how your feel, excepting what is, and
  letting that shit go. Its a mental and emotional spring cleaning. This is a
  class where we turn on some rock music a little louder than normal, to get out
  of our heads and just allow ourselves to FEEL. Its a fun class, good times and
  you’ll leave feeling emotionally 10lbs lighter!
