title: Suspension Band Training
---
Also known as TRX, or SBT, Suspension Band Training utilizes gravity and body weight to stabilize and train your core and virtually every other muscle in your body. This type of training builds a rock solid core, and reduces body fat while gaining strength and muscle. Every exercise is adjustable for all levels, simply changing the angle of your body changes the resistance, so this class is for everyone!
