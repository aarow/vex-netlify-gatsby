An energetic combination of strength, core, endurance and cardiovascular training. Each workout is designed to challenge your body in new and different ways so you will always feel excited about your next workout and will never get bored. These workouts create an “after burn” effect through interval training (HIIT) which will continue burning calories and fat long after your workout is over. These classes are designed for all fitness levels, and modifications will be offered to both reduce or increase the intensity to suit your personal goals and current fitness status.
